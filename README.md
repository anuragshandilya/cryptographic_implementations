Hi All,

I am sharing some cryptographic schemes and related algorithms that I implemented while learning. These are based on algorithms mentioned in various books or research papers (some may even be exactly same).

1. These code have not been tested for all scenerios so they may be incorrect. 
2. Some codes may be assuming many default values. You can change the values or implement the code with some real world values. I think code should work with real world scenerios also.
3. You can reuse the code in whatever way you want, but it'll be great if source is mentioned.
4. Most codes I share may be having worst time complexity. I'll upload optimal code also ones I am able to do it.

For any query or suggestion, feel free to contact me.

Happy programming!!!

Thank you!
